There's been a lot of recent attention on the the threat of antiobiotic resistence (see this recent NYTimes [piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/27/health/infection-raises-specter-of-superbugs-resistant-to-all-antibiotics.html?_r=0) for example). The usual explanation provided is that overuse of antiobiotics by doctors and by farmers has triggered the evolution of bacteria that are resistant to all available antibiotics. The conclusion follows that more needs to be done to curtail unnecessary antiobiotic use, and to develop novel antibiotics that can cope with the coming onslaught of resistant bacteria.

Many proposed solutions are policy-based. Incentive strategies could help spur the discovery and development of new antibiotics (see this [review](http://www.nature.com/ja/journal/v69/n2/full/ja201598a.html)). For example, some have proposed the establishment of [large prizes](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/02/24/an_antibiotic_discovery_prize) for antibiotic development, or the establishment of new research centers focused on the problem. Others suggest greater education of doctors and farmers to limit excessive antibiotic usage. While all of these suggestions have their place, the development of antibiotics raises serious scientific challenges that are less widely discussed.

For one, antibiotic development raises challenges that aren't present in other types of drug discovery (as with cancer for example). Most drugs today are explicitly created by chemical synthesis (with the exception of antibodies, which we won't discuss here). Unfortunately for chemists though, antibiotics tend to have complex molecular structures which complicate the use of chemical techniques. For example, compare the structures of the antibiotic [azithromycin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azithromycin#History) to that of [acetaminophen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol) (Tylenol). The molecular structure of azithromycin is significantly larger than that of acetaminophen. As a result, the methods of standard organic chemistry struggle to make meaningful modifications to the structure of complex molecules like azithromycin. The development of azithromycin itself was something of a chemical [odyssey](http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=110890&lang=en).

There has been some recent progress in chemistry that might eventually make it more feasible to chemically synthesize novel antibiotics. See [here](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/05/19/antibiotics-from-scratch) and [here](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/03/12/the_end_of_synthesis) for descriptions of new synthetic chemistry techniques that have the potential to allow for easier modifications of complex antiobiotic-like molecules. However, these advances are only first steps, and significantly greater work will be required over the next decade to mature and standardize these techniques.

Other parts of drug discovery hve benefited from the advent of databases like [Pubchem](http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/) and [Chembl](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) that allow for rapid searches through databases of biochemical experiments. However, these databases contain limited information about antibiotics. [CO-ADD](http://www.co-add.org/) is offering a service where compounds are tested for anti-microbial activity for free. The consortium is [planning](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/05/20/want-your-compounds-tested-against-pathogens-for-free) on releasing this dataset to the public in 2017.

As another note, standard drug-discovery has started to become increasingly computerized. Techniques based on machine-learning and on physical simulations are slowly becoming standard in conventional drug-discovery. Unfortunately, these techniques haven't yet been heavily applied to antibiotic discovery. For machine-learning techniques, the lack of large databases of antibiotic experiments has meant that training data has not been available. However, this should change in the near future for CO-ADD. On the side of physical simulations, the large computational requirements have meant that these techniques are just now being applied to simpler compounds (such as to kinase inhibitors by the [Chodera lab](http://www.choderalab.org/)). A few groups, such as the [Bowman group](http://bowmanlab.biochem.wustl.edu/) have started applying similar computational techniques to antibiotics, but work is just beginning in this space (see this [paper](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2016/md/c5md00325c) for example)

To summarize, antibiotic development has struggled because of the complex molecular structure of antibiotics, the lack of public databases of antibiotic experiments, and because of the dearth of computational work in the field. As we've seen though, there are hopeful signs of progress on these fronts. I'd encourage policy experiments and potential scientific donors to donate resources and money to these specific research directions, in addition to pursuing the policy-driven approches commonly proposed.
