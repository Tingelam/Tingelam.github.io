title: Why is it hard to make antibiotics?
---

[DRAFT]

There's been a lot of attention focused recently to the the threat of antiobiotic resistence (see this recent NYTimes [piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/27/health/infection-raises-specter-of-superbugs-resistant-to-all-antibiotics.html?_r=0) for example). The usual explanation provided is that overuse of antiobiotics by doctors and by the agricultural industry has triggered the evolution of bacteria that are resistant to all available antibiotics. The conclusion is that more needs to be done to develop novel antibiotics that can cope with the coming onslaught of resistent bacteria.

Many proposed solutions are based in policy. Incentive strategies could help spur the discovery and development of new antibiotics. http://www.nature.com/ja/journal/v69/n2/full/ja201598a.html. For example, some have proposed the establishment of prize grants (CITE) for antibiotic development, or the establishment of new research centers focused on the problem. Others suggest greater education of doctors and farmers to limit excessive antibiotic usage (CITE). While all of these suggestions have their place, the development of antibiotics raises serious scientific challenges that are less widely discussed.

Antibiotics raises many serious challenges that aren't present in other types of drug discovery (as with cancer for example). Historically, from penicillin onwards, most antibiotics have been discovered from natural sources (see [here](http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/flemingpenicillin.html) for an overview of penicillin's discovery).

One unfortunate fact about naturally discovered compounds tend to be quite complicated. For example, compare the structures of the antibiotic [azithromycin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azithromycin#History) to that of [acetaminophen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol) (Tylenol). The molecular structure of azithromycin is significantly larger than that of acetaminophen. As a result, the methods of standard organic chemistry struggle to make meaningful modifications to the structure of complex molecules like azithromycin.

Not enough understanding outside chemistry of just how challenging the problem of chemical synthesis is. While most natural compounds can be created by human chemistry, the procedure to do so can be exceedingly complex, involving up to 80 reactions in sequence, and can yield only milligrams of the desired substance at the end.

The heart of modern drug discovery is medicinal chemistry, and the most potent tool in the medicinal chemist's toolkit is her ability to iteratively alter the structure of a proposed drug to "optimize" its efficacy, metabolic properties, and toxicity profile. For antibiotics, the extreme difficulty of performing synthetic modifications means that chemists are effectively crippled when working with these compounds (This description is partially exaggerated. See [here](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/05/19/antibiotics-from-scratch) and [here](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/03/12/the_end_of_synthesis) for descriptions of new synthetic chemistry techniques that have the potential to allow for easier modifications of complex antiobiotic-like molecules. However, the fact that cutting-edge research potentially solves the problem just highlights the depth of the challenges here).

Another serious challenge is the fact that there are few public repositories of known antibiotics. Pubchem and Chembl (CITE) are great sources of experimental data for other types of drug-discovery. No similar database yet exists for the antibiotic space. CO-ADD (link) is offering a service where compounds are tested against a battery of assays (experiments that cultivate bacteria and report the response to an introduced compound). Should be a strong resource for future work, especially once dataset is released to the public in 2017.

As academics, we need to start paying as much attention to antibiotics as we do to anti-cancer drugs.

Not to mention that many dangerous bacteria are quite challenging to cultivate, so it's harder to do assays in-house

We should also do more long MD simulations of antibiotic binding as well (like for kinases). Long molecular dynamics simulations yield physical understanding of the methods of binding for antiobiotics. There should be a scientific question in mind, with experiments designed to address it, rather than "We ran MD and it wiggled".

@jchodera Good point. Needs some thought here

@rbhar90 Greg Bowman at WashU is doing some great work with identifying targetable allosteric binding sites for antibiotic targets.
