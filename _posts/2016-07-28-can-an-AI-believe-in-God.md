## A New Post

Question of whether an artificial intelligence can believe in God. I don't see why not. AI should learn emotions, should be quite likely.

Much of the singularitan, transhuman crowd is rationalist.

Bhakti tradition hinges on a personal connection with the deity. To the practioner, the God is as real as a closest friend, a mother, a father, a brother, or even a lover. In some respects, neatly sidesteps the question of whether God exists. The belief is real regardless of the broader metaphysical status of reality.

In that same way, if an AI can fall in love (see her), there should be no reason an AI couldn't believe in God.

Should I write this one? Might not be well suited to American temperaments.
