DISEASES
--------
Bacterial infections are cured by flushing out all the bacteria from the body.

Cancer is "cured" by flushing all the cancer cells out (killing them). In practice, remission rates remain high since not all cancer cells are killed.

Immuno disorders (allergies, rheumatoid arthritis) appear to have behavioral causes. Lack of exposure to "dirty" environments might have caused these diseases.

Obesity has no real cure. Diet and exercise help, but there appears to be a high rate of recidivism.

Genetic disorders result from small mutations to critical genes. Often, single proteins cease to function properly, causing issues.

METHODS OF FINDING CURES
------------------------
GWAS studies sequence thousands of patients and healthy people, and use a statistical model to find genomic variants correlated with the disease outcome.

Knockout studies use gene editing in mice to test whether introducing or removing a gene causes onset or cure to the disease.
