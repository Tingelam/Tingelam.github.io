DISEASES
--------
Bacterial infections are cured by flushing out all the bacteria from the body. Viral infections are also cured by flushing viruses out of the body. The problem is dealing with "viral reservoirs" that store parts of the disease even after the main viral bodies have been flushed. A big problem in finding a cure to AIDS.

Cancer is "cured" by flushing all the cancer cells out (killing them). In practice, remission rates remain high since not all cancer cells are killed.

Immuno disorders (allergies, rheumatoid arthritis) appear to have behavioral causes. Lack of exposure to "dirty" environments might have caused these diseases.

Obesity has no real cure. Diet and exercise help, but there appears to be a high rate of recidivism. Some rising evidence that microbiomes (the community of bacteria which naturally live in human intestines) may play critical roles in such disorders, but the links here are very tentative at best.

Genetic disorders result from small mutations to critical genes. Often, single proteins cease to function properly, causing issues.

METHODS OF FINDING CURES
------------------------
GWAS studies sequence thousands of patients and healthy people, and use a statistical model to find genomic variants correlated with the disease outcome.

Knockout studies use gene editing in mice to test whether introducing or removing a gene causes onset or cure to the disease.

Basic strategy is to create a "model organism". That is, genetically modify or breed or infect animals (typically rats or mice) so that they have a version of the disease in question. Apply proposed treatments to said animals until one works. Move forward with that treatment to tests with human patients.

This approach has many strengths. Since human understanding of biology is quite weak, it allows for testing biology with biology. The downside is that it's not easy to make animal models for more complex diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases or mental disorders.

An improvement in this space is the advent of organoid models which grow cultures of cells into three dimensions pseudo-organs.
