There's been a lot of attention focused recently to the the threat of antiobiotic resistence (see this recent NYTimes [piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/27/health/infection-raises-specter-of-superbugs-resistant-to-all-antibiotics.html?_r=0) for example). The usual explanation provided is that overuse of antiobiotics by doctors and by the agricultural industry has triggered the evolution of bacteria that are resistant to all available antibiotics. The conclusion is that more needs to be done to develop novel antibiotics that can cope with the coming onslaught of resistent bacteria.

The fact is that antibiotic-resistance is a very serious matter that requires significantly more attention from the scientific community. At the same time, the development of antibiotics raises many serious challenges that aren't present in other types of drug discovery (as with cancer for example). Historically, from penicillin onwards, most antibiotics have been discovered from natural sources (see [here](http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/flemingpenicillin.html) for an overview of penicillin's discovery).

One unfortunate fact about naturally discovered compounds tend to be quite complicated. For example, compare the structures of the antibiotic [azithromycin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azithromycin#History) to that of [acetaminophen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol) (Tylenol). The molecular structure of azithromycin

As academics, we need to start paying as much attention to antibiotics as we do to anti-cancer drugs.

In fact more, since antiobiotics are structurally more complicated on average, and require harder chemical syntheses

Not enough understanding outside chemistry of just how challenging the problem of chemical synthesis is. While most natural compounds can be created by human chemistry, the procedure to do so can be exceedingly complex, involving up to 80 reactions in sequence, and can yield only milligrams of the desired substance at the end.

Not to mention that many dangerous bacteria are quite challenging to cultivate, so it's harder to do assays in-house

Incentive strategies could help spur the discovery and development of new antibiotics. http://www.nature.com/ja/journal/v69/n2/full/ja201598a.html â€¦John Chodera added,

We should also do more long MD simulations of antibiotic binding as well (like for kinases). Long molecular dynamics simulations yield physical understanding of the methods of binding for antiobiotics. There should be a scientific question in mind, with experiments designed to address it, rather than "We ran MD and it wiggled".

@jchodera Good point. Needs some thought here

@rbhar90 Greg Bowman at WashU is doing some great work with identifying targetable allosteric binding sites for antibiotic targets.

CO-ADD (link) is offering a service where compounds are tested against a battery of assays (experiments that cultivate bacteria and report the response to an introduced compound). Should be a strong resource for future work, especially once dataset is released to the public in 2017.
