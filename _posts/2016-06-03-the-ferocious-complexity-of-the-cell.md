Fifty years ago, the first molecular dynamics papers simulated systems with a few dozen atoms for picoseconds (a picosecond is one-trillionth of a second). Today, due to tremendous gains in computational capability from Moore's law, and due to significant gains in algorithmic sophisticiation from fifty years of researcher, scientists can simulate systems with hundreds of thousands of atoms for milliseconds at a time. To summarize, scientists today can study systems tens of thousands of times larger, for a billion times longer than they could fifty years go. In total, the effective reach of physical simulation techniques has expanded handleable complexity ten-trillion fold.

This suggests that one day we should be able to understand a complete human cell.
But how complex is an actual cell? A quick check to [references](http://book.bionumbers.org/how-big-is-a-human-cell/) suggests that a human sperm cell has a volume of 30 cubic micrometers. Another check to a [reference](http://book.bionumbers.org/what-is-the-density-of-cells/) suggests that many human cells have densities quite similar to that of water (1000 kg per cubic meter). Now, using the final fact that the molar mass of water is 18 grams, a quick calculation suggests that human sperm cells have roughly a trillion atoms. For another datapoint, [assuming](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1058674183710165) neuronal cell volume of 6000 cubic micrometers, the analogous number for neurons is roughly 175 trillion atoms per cell. In addition to the increased spatial complexity, cellular processes take much longer than molecular processes, with mitosis (cell division) occurring on the order of hours. Let’s assume that mitosis takes eight hours for a standard cell. Putting together the series of calculations that we've just done suggests that exhaustively understanding a single sperm cell would require an increase in spatial complexity from hundreds of thousands of atoms to trillions of atoms, and from millisecond simulations to multi-hour simulations. Put another way, exhaustive simulations of sperm cells will require 10 million fold increases in spatial complexity and about 10 million fold increase in simulation length, for a total increase in complexity on the order of the hundred-trillion fold. Assuming Moore's law continues in some form, we are at least 50 years of hard research away from achieving thorough understanding of the simplest of human cells.

Let's extend the thought experiment a bit further. How far is human science from understanding a human brain? There [are](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2776484/) roughly a hundred-billion neurons in the brain, and human-learning occurs on the order of years (say 1 year). To understand the brain requires  100-billion (10^11) fold increase in spatial complexity, and 1000-fold (10^3) increase in time complexity. Another 14 orders of magnitude.

Thus assuming Moore’s law keeps humming along at its exponential rate (by no means guaranteed!), it will take us 100 years to completely understand the brain at an atomistic level. That said, even the former statement is an oversimplification. An important point is that all nontrivial molecules exhibit quantum entanglement. In order to get truly accurate simulations of the cell, it will likely be necessary to perform extremely large quantum simulations on large quantum computers. Those also remain far off in today's reality of qunatum computers. We can’t even model ATP in our complex simulations.  It is very likely that quantum phenomenon are critical in the brain, even if Penrose's hypothesis that the brain is a quantum computer isn't valid (CITE). 

Simple back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest the incredible complexity required to actually simulate the brain. It follows that the load-your-brain into the cloud singulatarians are very naive about the complexities present in systems like the brain.

Why is this dangerous though? Naive forecasts raise hype, and create unrealistic expectations which we will certainly fail to meet. We run the risk of another AI winter if we can't control unreasonable expectations from the public and from funding agencies.
