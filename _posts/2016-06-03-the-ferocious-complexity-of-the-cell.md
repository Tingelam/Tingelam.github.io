Fifty years ago, the first molecular dynamics papers simulated systems with a few dozen atoms for picoseconds (a picosecond is one-trillionth of a second). Today, due to tremendous gains in computational capability from Moore's law, and due to significant gains in algorithmic sophisticiation from fifty years of researcher, scientists can simulate systems with hundreds of thousands of atoms for milliseconds at a time. To summarize, scientists today can study systems tens of thousands of times larger, for a billion times longer than they could fifty years go. In total, the effective reach of physical simulation techniques has expanded handleable complexity ten-trillion fold.

This suggests that one day we should be able to understand a complete human cell.
But how complex is an actual cell? A quick check to [references](http://book.bionumbers.org/how-big-is-a-human-cell/) suggests that a small human cell has a volume of 30 cubic micrometers. Another check to a [reference](http://book.bionumbers.org/what-is-the-density-of-cells/) suggests that many human cells have densities quite similar to that of water (1000 kg per cubic meter). Now, using the final fact that the molar mass of water is 18g, a quick calculation suggests that small human cells have roughly a trillion atoms. [Assuming](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1058674183710165) neuronal volume of 6000 cubic micrometers, that comes out to roughly 175 trillion atoms in an average neuron). Cellular processes take much longer. Cell division on the order of hours. Let’s say 8 hrs for a standard cell. Exhaustively understanding a single cell would consequently take 10 million fold (7 orders) of spatial improvement and about 10 million fold (10^7) increase in time complexity. Total of 14 orders of magnitude.

But then, what about understanding a human brain? There are 100-billion neurons in the brain (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2776484/), and human-learning occurs on the order of years (say 1 year). To understand the brain requires  100-billion (10^11) fold increase in spatial complexity, and 1000-fold (10^3) increase in time complexity. Another 14 orders of magnitude.

Thus assuming Moore’s law keeps humming along at its exponential rate (by no means guaranteed!), it will take us 100 years to completely understand the brain at an atomistic level. That said, even the former statement is an oversimplification. An important point is that all nontrivial molecules exhibit quantum entanglement. In order to get truly accurate simulations of the cell, it will likely be necessary to perform extremely large quantum simulations on large quantum computers. Those also remain far off in today's reality of qunatum computers. We can’t even model ATP in our complex simulations.  It is very likely that quantum phenomenon are critical in the brain, even if Penrose's hypothesis that the brain is a quantum computer isn't valid (CITE). 

Simple back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest the incredible complexity required to actually simulate the brain. It follows that the load-your-brain into the cloud singulatarians are very naive about the complexities present in systems like the brain.

Why is this dangerous though? Naive forecasts raise hype, and create unrealistic expectations which we will certainly fail to meet. We run the risk of another AI winter if we can't control unreasonable expectations from the public and from funding agencies.
