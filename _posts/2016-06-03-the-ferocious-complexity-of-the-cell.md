50 years ago first molecular dynamics papers simulated systems with 10s  of atoms for picoseconds (10^-12). Today, due to tremendous gains in Moore’s law, we can simulate systems with 100,000s of atoms for milliseconds (10^-3). 10^4 increase in size, 10^9 increase in time, for a total of 13 orders of magnitude.

This suggests that one day we should be able to understand a complete human cell.
But how complex is an actual cell? Estimates vary, but perhaps one trillion (10^12) atoms in a small cell (CITE). Cellular processes take much longer. Cell division on the order of hours. Let’s say 8 hrs for a standard cell. Exhaustively understanding a single cell would consequently take 10 million fold (7 orders) of spatial improvement and about 10 million fold (10^7) increase in time complexity. Total of 14 orders of magnitude.

But then, what about understanding a human brain? There are 100-billion neurons in the brain, and human-learning occurs on the order of years (say 1 year). To understand the brain requires  100-billion (10^11) fold increase in spatial complexity, and 1000-fold (10^3) increase in time complexity. Another 14 orders of magnitude.

Simple back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest the incredible complexity required to actually simulate the brain. It follows that the load-your-brain into the cloud singulatarians are very naive about the complexities present in systems like the brain.

Why is this dangerous though? Naive forecasts raise hype, and create unrealistic expectations which we will certainly fail to meet. We run the risk of another AI winter if we can't control unreasonable expectations from the public and from funding agencies.

Thus assuming Moore’s law keeps humming along at its exponential rate (by no means guaranteed!), it will take us 100 years to understand the brain…

But wait, won’t there be a feedback effect from our deeper understanding of algorithms? Yes, but there will be a counter feedback: QM is much more intricately linked to biological function than is apparent. We can’t even model ATP in our complex simulations. Counter exponential feedback.

An important point is that all nontrivial molecules exhibit quantum entanglement. In order to get truly accurate simulations of the cell, it will likely be necessary to perform extremely large quantum simulations on large quantum computers. Those also remain far off in today's reality of qunatum computers.
