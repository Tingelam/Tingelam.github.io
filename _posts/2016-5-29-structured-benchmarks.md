Just read the beautiful paper "Could a neuroscientist understand a microprocessor?" http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/05/26/055624 â€¦

The paper simulates simple microprocessor (for arcade games) and uses techniques of neuroinformatics (read: Machine learning) to analyze

Some techniques yield interesting insight. PCA reveals clock-ticks for example, but constructed insight very incomplete.

No way to build new microprocessors using analysis. Paper ends by suggesting that more neuroscientists try to understand microprocessors

I'd further that by arguing that Machine-learning should use this as a benchmark. Can our algorithms learn complex causal structures?

Probably not! Maybe something for folks at @OpenAI to add to their Gym suite?
