I received a BA and BS from UC Berkeley in EECS and Mathematics and was valedictorian of my graduating class in mathematics. I am currently a PhD student in computer science at Stanford University. My research focuses on the application of deep-learning to problems in drug-discovery.

I am supported by a Hertz Fellowship.
